#OCR
<br>
OCR app made primarily in octave
<br>
Client made in python
<br>
(Client looks horrible so I am not uploading it yet)
<br>
<h4> <u> Issues I know of: </u> </h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li> Speed: It is too slow, Any suggestions would be appreciated </li>
  <li> Comments: I tried commenting each block, but most of it still doesn't make sense to people who are reading it for the first time </li>
  <li> Documentation: No documentation (yet) </li>
  <li> Works only for single digits, should be solved by March </li>
  <li> Works only for BW images, should be solved by January </li>
  <li> Works for very small images, should be solved by January </li>
  <li> Need to upload Python Client, should be solved whenever I make NN1 public, because client is client for both, and crashes if has access to only one... </li>
  <li> Does not have a sanity check for over-fitting or under-fitting.</li>
  <li> Accuracy: 95.66% last time I checked, which was 8/12/2017 8:55 AM
</ul>
<br>
Sorry for the tardiness in uploading all this code because I was just super lazy and never used github... I still need to upload a lot of other projects...
<h4> <u> Suggestions I know of: </u> </h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li> Overfitting/Underfitting: this'll be solved whenever NN1 goes public because of my overfitting/underfitting checks in those programs (basically checks for smoothness, % accuracy, general shape of the curve, etc.) </li>
  <li> Bad Suggestion for accuracy: "Use more internal levels or Use more nodes per level", I would like to but would like to prevent overfitting </li>
  <li> Upload client: It'll happen when I make NN1 public </li>
</ul>
