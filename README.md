# OCR
Simple OCR app made in Octave, client in Python.
<br>
Replace data1.m with whatever you want and then run the app in Octave (or matlab, if that's the way you swing). Works with numbers (0-9) in BW (for now). [0 is label 10]
<br>
Current accuracy: 95.6%, gotta make it better.
<br>
Issues: Too slow, any help would be apreciated
<br>
Name: Gotta change it to something more original rather than ex4 or exasperated attempt 4 (eh, whatever right?)
