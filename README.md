# OCR
Simple OCR app made in Octave, client in Python.
Replace data1.m with whatever you want and then run the app in Octave (or matlab, if that's the way you swing). Works with numbers (0-9) in BW (for now). [0 is label 10]
Current accuracy: 95.6%, gotta make it better.
Issues: Too slow, any help would be apreciated
Name: Gotta change it to something more original rather than ex4 or exasperated attempt 4 (eh, whatever right?)
